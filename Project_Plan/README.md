# Project Plan

## Objective
This project aimed to collect, analyze, and visualise health-related data from various sources, enabling stakeholders (physicians, researchers, professors) to understand the data easily using Power BI dashboards and an intuitive user interface.

## Timeline:
1. August 2023 - December 2023: Data collection on US states, focusing on health-related topics.
2. January 2024 - May 2024: Data collection on federal health topics and international country data.
3. August 2024 - December 2024: Data collection on health issues, with a focus on data analysis across all previously collected datasets. Additionally, the **UI/UX design phase** was completed during this period, improving the overall user experience.

### Key Milestones:
- Data Collection: Completed data collection across multiple domains (state, federal, international).
- Power BI Implementation: Launched Power BI dashboards integrated into the database.
- UI/UX Design: Completed the UI/UX design for Database, which will greatly enhanced user interaction and accessibility.
- SQL Training: Provided training for students on different levels of SQL (basic, advanced, and database-specific) through LinkedIn Learning platform.
- Manual Creation: Created a comprehensive manual for future project managers to follow similar processes.

### Recognition:
Our project received significant recognition at “Indiana University, Indianapolis”, where it was highlighted for its impact and contribution to the health informatics field. This recognition further solidified the importance of the work in enhancing healthcare data transparency and user engagement.

### Stakeholders:
- Physicians, researchers, professors (for Power BI dashboards).
- Students (for SQL training, data collection and analysis ).
